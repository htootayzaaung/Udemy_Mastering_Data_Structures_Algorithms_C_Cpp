Physical data-structures
________________________

_Arrays and Linked-lists are called as physical data-structures because they
decides or defines how the memory is organized and how the memory is allocated.

_Physical data-structures are meant for storing the data, they actually stores
the data in memory.

______
Arrays
______

_Arrays are a collection of contiguous memory locations, all these locations are
side-by-side.

_Arrays have fixed-size (i.e static), once it is created of some size, then it
cannot be expanded nor contracted.

_There can be a pointer pointing to this array, so they can be created in inside
the stack or inside heap.

____________
Linked-lists
____________

_Linked-lists are dynamic data-structure, and they are a collection of nodes,
where each node contains data and is linked to the next node.

_The size of the linked-list can grow and reduce dynamically, therefore it has a
variable length.

_The linked-list is always created in the heap.

_The head-pointer maybe in the stack.

1.) Stack (LIFO)         |_ Linear data-structures
2.) Queues (FIFO)       _|

3.) Trees                |_ Non-linear data-structures

5.) Hash-tables         -> Linear or Tabular data-structure

_Assuming that you have already got your physical data-structures, there may be
some operations that may be required to be carried out: inserting more values,
deleting existing values, searching for values and many more.

_Now there is a question, how do we implement them? This is where Stack, Queues,
Trees, Graph and Hash-tables comes to the spotlight.
